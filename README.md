In this repository is a convolutional neural network trained on source-over-cable field CDP gathers to reconstruct the near offset gap in marine seismic data. The model is a Tensorflow .h5 file. This model was trained on gathers of shape (448x24), which corresponded to (448x2ms =) 896 milliseconds of traveltime, and (24x75m =) 1800 meters of offset. The first two traces (0th and 1st) should be zero before input to the model. Examples of how to use the model to make predictions are shown in the Jupyter Notebook. The field data cannot be shared, as it belongs to Aker BP. If your data dimensions are significantly different than the ones we used, but you would like to use the method, you can reach out to me (orowhuff@gmail.com) and I may be able to train a new model with image dimensions that better suit you.
